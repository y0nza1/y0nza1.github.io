    <main>
        <p>Hi there. This is my website, where I host updates on my projects and perhaps other things about myself in general.</p>
        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I'm currently a student at SCC (Sacramento City College). My current goal is to get my AA in Computer Science. My interests include building and modding keyboards, arranging music, and game development. Oh, and of course - I do like playing video games too, but I just don't have the time anymore for 15 hour gaming sessions.</p>
        <h3>About This Website</h3>
        <p>I'm enrolled in CISW327, and taking the opportunity to work on this website as a personal project while tackling the assignments at the same time. I'll document my progress throughout the weeks, and hopefully the result is something serviceable! I don't really mind the Craiglist aesthetic sometimes, though.</p>
