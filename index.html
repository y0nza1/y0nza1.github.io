<p>Hi there. This is my website, where I host updates on my projects and perhaps other things about myself in general.</p>
<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I'm currently a student at SCC (Sacramento City College). My current goal is to get my AS in Computer Science while I finish up requirements to transfer to UC Davis for Political Science. My other interests include building and modding keyboards, arranging music, and game development. Oh, and of course - I do like playing video games too, but I just don't have the time anymore for 15 hour gaming sessions.</p>
<h3>What I Work With</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Linux (Debian 12 is my distro of choice)</li>
    <li>neovim</li>
    <li>GitHub</li>
    <li>Some kind of keyboard with Tsangan layout</li>
</ul>
<h3>What I'm Working On</h3>
<ul>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>HTML/CSS</li>
    <li>Algorithm Design</li>
</ul>
